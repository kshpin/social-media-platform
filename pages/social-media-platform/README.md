# Social Media Platform

This is a simple front end page for a social media platform, built using React.

There is functionality to see a list of all posts, as well as to add a new post, with an authentication check.

This page relies on:

-   the worker (in the same repository), as that is the backend for this project
-   the authentication server (in a separate repository), which performs simple simple user authentications

To launch, run:

```
$ npm start
```
